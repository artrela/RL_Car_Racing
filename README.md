# RL_Car_Racing
An introduction to common reinforcement methods (RL) leveraging Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym), as a featured part of Carnegie Mellon University's MRSD Summer Software Bootcamp. 

## Learning Objectives:
1. Introduction to RL & Algorithsm  
    1.1 Deep Q-Learning (DQN)  
    1.2 Double DQN (DDQN)  
    1.3 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) - `COMING SOON`
2. Getting started with and understanding Gymnasium (previously OpenAI Gym)
3. Getting exposure to some MLOps tools 
    3.1 Weights and Biases (WandB)  
    3.2 Data Version Control (DVC) - `COMING SOON`  

## Assignment Output: 

When completed, you should obtain an RL agent that learned to drive completely on its own
accord. The agent below was trained using a DDQN model with nothing but images of the environment
and a set of actions to choose from.
